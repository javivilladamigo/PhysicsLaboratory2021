1. Calibrate the GAMMA SPECTRA (detectors 1, 2, 3 and 4). (Javi)

2. Calibrate TAC. (Attilio)

3. TWO PHOTONS DECAY (Attilio)
	3.1 Set proper energy window for detector #1 and #2.
	3.2 Set proper temporal window for TAC to reject uncorrelated events.
	3.3 Verify that the energy in case of two photons is in agreement with the theory.
	3.4 Display two-photon counts per unit of time.

4. THREE PHOTONS DECAY (Javi)
	4.1 Set proper energy window for detector #1, #2 and #3.
	4.2 Set proper temporal window for TAC to reject uncorrelated events.
	4.3 Verify that the energy in case of three photons is in agreement with the theory.
	4.4 Display three-photon counts per unit of time.
	
5. COMPARISON between two-photon events and three-photon events and determine the RATIO. Roles of geometry and efficiency of detectors? Discuss the necessary corrections. 

6. Compare the TIME SPECTRA measured in the two experimental configurations.

7. Build the SUM SPECTRA for the two experimental configurations.

8. Check DEAD TIME of the system and make any corrections to the results if needed.
